# Push_swap

## 📋 Description

**push_swap** is a 42 School sorting project that challenges you to sort numbers in a stack using limited operations with the minimum number of moves. This project implements the **Turkish Algorithm**, an efficient strategy that calculates the cost of each move and always chooses the most economical option.
